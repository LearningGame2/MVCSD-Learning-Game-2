Here are some ideas we came up with in the first meeting at Wiggin Street Elementary.

Connor's Group...

Subjects:
1. Science
- The kids almost all said their favorite subject was science.
- They were really excited about force of motion.
- Other topics included light and sound.
2. Math
- Multiplying decimals
- Percentages
- Fraction operations??
3. ELA
- No info provided
4. Social studies
- Native American history

Game Ideas:
- Most of the kids in my group said their favorite game was Minecraft.
They seemed to be enthusiastic about a survival based game. I gave them 
"The Oregon Trail" as an example, which they had all played. 
	-> Arctic survival 
	-> Early in history -> late in history
	-> Fight mobs, buy pet to defend mobs
	-> Try to get rescued to win game.
	-> Fishing/food
- Another game idea we came up with is something similar to Donkey Kong, 
where you would need to answer a question to go up a level. The kids also 
suggested that there be coins to pick up along the way, which you could use
to buy a new avatar to play as. 

Games the kids play:
- Minecraft
- Helix jump
- Flappy Bird
- Mariocart

Other good ideas:
- Questions get harder as game progresses (as you pass levels)
- Bonuses for correct answer streaks
