Here are some ideas we came up with in the first meeting at Wiggin Street Elementary.

Connor's Group...

Subjects:
1. Science
- The kids almost all said their favorite subject was science.
- They were really excited about force of motion.
- Other topics included light and sound.
2. Math
- Multiplying decimals
- Percentages
- Fraction operations??
3. ELA
- No info provided
4. Social studies
- Native American history

Game Ideas:
- Most of the kids in my group said their favorite game was Minecraft.
They seemed to be enthusiastic about a survival based game. I gave them 
"The Oregon Trail" as an example, which they had all played. 
	-> Arctic survival 
	-> Early in history -> late in history
	-> Fight mobs, buy pet to defend mobs
	-> Try to get rescued to win game.
	-> Fishing/food
- Another game idea we came up with is something similar to Donkey Kong, 
where you would need to answer a question to go up a level. The kids also 
suggested that there be coins to pick up along the way, which you could use
to buy a new avatar to play as. 

Games the kids play:
- Minecraft
- Helix jump
- Flappy Bird
- Mariocart

Other good ideas:
- Questions get harder as game progresses (as you pass levels)
- Bonuses for correct answer streaks




Sam's Group...


Top 3 Game Ideas:
1. Spelling
2. Math
3. Science
4. ELA(?  how to turn into game?)

Important Components:
- user feedback (Rewards ex. pets, customization from in-game store)
    - see progress
- instructions and options
- levels of different difficulty
- spaced repetition.  Kids said it was really annoying when a game gave you a question you just got right or wrong.  Like Quizlet!
- see progress (save high and low scores?)
    - compete against past self

A lot of the kids' favorite game was Prodigy.  It's a math game that is
based around a quest-type format, incorporating the learning into the
larger overall game, to complete side quests, etc.  Hard for us to make a
story type game in the time that we have, but we can make it more fun w/
visuals and maybe animations.
They also brought up ABCya, which gamifies learning English, probably closer
to what is within our capabilities.  A little bit like Quizlet's games,
the central part is the game format (ex. shoot down asteroids or something)
where the user has to answer questions correctly to use power-ups, abilities,
etc. to win the game (and of course lose if they get it wrong).


Fun Components If Time:
- different modes
    - visuals: ninjas!
- various AIs
- online, play other users
- science games --> interactive
