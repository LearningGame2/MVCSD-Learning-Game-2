        Some background info on this project: <br><br>

        This website was produced by 3 students of Kenyon College: Connor Dailey, Mason Fishell, and Sam Rabieh, for the class Software 
        and Systems Design with Professor James Skon.  It is a collaboration with Wiggin St. Elementary School, created for the learning 
        and enjoyment of Ms. Brenneman's fifth grade class.  Most Tuesdays of February — March 2022, we came in and discussed programming, 
        what's important in good game design, and what questions we should actually put in the game. <br><br>

        However, this would not have been possible coding entirely on our own from the ground up.  We did a lot of hard work putting together 
        the different parts of our project — and believe us, there are a lot of parts to it — and we wrote the code for the actual website all 
        by ourselves, but we implemented the structure of the quiz and the minigames from open-source code we found elsewhere online.  We 
        found the code for a quiz game and started working with it just to learn a few things, and both we and the students really liked it 
        so we stuck with that design.  A few weeks before the end of the semester, we finally got our MySQL database to connect with the 
        website to allow users to log in and get randomized questions through the phpMyAdmin interface.  Then it was time to decide how we 
        could make it better and more fun to use.  We don't have much experience working with graphics, so we didn't want to waste time trying 
        to build a game ourselves from scratch, especially if it might not be that good in the end.  We implemented 4 games to keep it fun in 
        between the levels of the quiz, and we think we succeeded.  Enjoy!<br><br><br>
