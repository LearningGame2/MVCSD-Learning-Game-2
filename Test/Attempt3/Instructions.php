            Packabunchas: fit the shapes into the box!
            <ul>
                <li>Double click on a shape to rotate (make sure you click hard on your Chromebooks!)
                <li>Click and drag shapes into the box so that they cover all the empty squares and don't go outside of the box
                <li>Tips: start with sections that only certain pieces could fill, if a piece doesn't work in an orientation,<br>
                take them out and try each one by one, and keep at it!  They all have at least one solution.
            </ul>
            <br>
            HexGL: stay on track and don't crash...
            <ul>
                <li>Press up arrow key to increase engine power
                <li>Use side arrow keys to navigate the course
                <li>You only have a limited amount of health and you can't get it back, so be cautious rather than speedy!<br>
                    Otherwise, you won't get a score multiplier
            </ul>
            <br>
            Astronaut: You have one objective â€” survive in the vacuum of space.

                <li>Press space to jump, and not too early!
                <li>Don't fall between the ships
            </ul>
            <br>
            Duck Hunt: This one's a classic.  You know the drill.
            <ul>
                <li>Click to shoot the ducks
                <li>Don't waste your anmo
